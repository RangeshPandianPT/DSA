# 📂 Data Structures

This section covers core data structures that form the foundation of problem-solving.

## Topics

| # | Topic | Key Concepts |
|---|-------|--------------|
| 04 | Linked Lists | Singly, Doubly, Circular, Reversal |
| 05 | Stacks | LIFO, Parentheses, Monotonic Stack |
| 06 | Queues | FIFO, Circular Queue, Deque |
| 07 | Hash Tables | HashMap, HashSet, Frequency Count |
| 08 | Trees | Binary Tree, BST, Traversals |
| 09 | Heaps | Min/Max Heap, Priority Queue |
| 10 | Graphs | BFS, DFS, Adjacency List |

## When to Use What?

| Data Structure | Use When |
|----------------|----------|
| Array | Fixed size, random access needed |
| LinkedList | Frequent insertions/deletions |
| Stack | LIFO order, backtracking |
| Queue | FIFO order, BFS |
| HashMap | O(1) lookup by key |
| Tree | Hierarchical data |
| Heap | Quick min/max access |
| Graph | Relationships between entities |
